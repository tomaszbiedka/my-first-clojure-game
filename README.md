## Introduction
My first clojure game.

Inspired by James Trunk ["Game development in Clojure with play-clj & Light Table"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ilUe7Re-RA).

Drawings made by my 6-years-old daughter.

## How to run the game
1) Download and install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
2) Run "lein repl" inside project folder.
3) Run "(-main)" function inside repl.
```
> lein repl
> clojure-play-clj.core.desktop-launcher=> (-main)
```

## Change the game art
Encourage your child to draw their own game art. Replace the game's resources:
* /resources/background.png (800 x 600)
* /resources/horse.png (300 x 187)
* /resources/fruit.png (50 x 61)
